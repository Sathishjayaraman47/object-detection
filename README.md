# Abstract
Good vision is a precious gift but unfortunately loss of vision is becoming common now a days. To help the blind people the visual world has to be transformed into the audio world with the potential to inform them about objects as well as their spatial locations. Objects detected from the scene are represented by their names and converted to speech. Everybody deserves to live independently, especially those who disabled, with the last decades, technology gives attention to disabled to make them control their life as possible.In this work, assistive system for blind is suggested, to let him knows what is around him, by using YOLO v8 for detecting objects within images quickly based on deep neural network to make accurate detection, and Open CV under Python. The obtained results indicated the success of the proposed model in giving blind users the capability to move around in unfamiliar indoor outdoor environment, through a user. This project involved Artificial intelligence to detect and analyze objects and send details via speaker In the proposed work, we solve the existing system problem by using dark net YOLO techniques that are used to reduce the recognize time of multi objects in less time with best time complexities.
